This project was made with React and Bootstrap. I learned a lot with this project, it's my first time doing something more complex with the HTML5 audio tag, so I had to look up a bunch of documentation on how to properly use it with React and JavaScript. The project itself, is a drum machine with 9 pads that can be clicked or activated with a key, I used map on the sound bank to create the initial layout and have access to every single pad. Also I made a volume bar that changes the volume of the pads, I solved this using state. Also we can switch from sound bank 1 and sound bank 2 with buttons. Below the volume bar is an element that displays the "name" of the pad when it's played, although this only works when you click the element, because i couldn't find out how to access the current id property outside the map function. Another problem is that you can't tap a single pad too fast because the sound must finish before you can play it again, I couldn't solve this either. Even if I had problems, I still consider this project a huge learning point for me.
